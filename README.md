## üîß Development Features

- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- React Query DevTools for debugging data fetching
- TypeScript for better development experience
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

## üêõ Troubleshooting

1. **Port Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # If ports 3000 or 8000 are in use, modify docker-compose.yml or use:
   # Frontend: npm start -- --port 3001
   # Backend: python manage.py runserver 8001
   ```

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Maximum file size: 10MB
   - Ensure proper permissions on media directory
   - Check network tab for detailed error messages

3. **Database Issues**
   ```bash
   # Reset database
   rm backend/data/db.sqlite3
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

# Project Submission Instructions

## Preparing Your Submission

1. Before creating your submission zip file, ensure:
   - All features are implemented and working as expected
   - All tests are passing
   - The application runs successfully locally
   - Remove any unnecessary files or dependencies
   - Clean up any debug/console logs

2. Create the submission zip file:
   ```bash
   # Activate your backend virtual environment first
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Run the submission script from the project root
   cd ..
   python create_submission_zip.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Create a zip file named `username_YYYYMMDD.zip` (e.g., `johndoe_20240224.zip`)
   - Respect .gitignore rules to exclude unnecessary files
   - Preserve file timestamps
   - Show you a list of included files and total size
   - Warn you if the zip is unusually large

3. Verify your submission zip file:
   - Extract the zip file to a new directory
   - Ensure all necessary files are included
   - Verify that no unnecessary files (like node_modules, __pycache__, etc.) are included
   - Test the application from the extracted files to ensure everything works

## Video Documentation Requirement

**Video Guidance** - Record a screen share demonstrating:
- How you leveraged Gen AI to help build the features
- Your prompting techniques and strategies
- Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them
- Your thought process in using AI effectively

**IMPORTANT**: Please do not provide a demo of the application functionality. Focus only on your Gen AI usage and approach.

## Submission Process

1. Submit your project through this Google Form:
   [Project Submission Form](https://forms.gle/nr6DZAX3nv6r7bru9)

2. The form will require:
   - Your project zip file (named `username_YYYYMMDD.zip`)
   - Your video documentation
   - Any additional notes or comments about your implementation

Make sure to test the zip file and video before submitting to ensure they are complete and working as expected.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd abnormal-file-vault
   ```

2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api

### Development Mode

Both the frontend and backend support hot reloading in development mode, so changes will be reflected automatically without having to restart the containers.

## API Endpoints

### Files API

- `GET /api/files/` - List all files with optional filtering
- `POST /api/files/upload/` - Upload a new file with deduplication
- `DELETE /api/files/{id}/` - Delete a file
- `GET /api/stats/` - Get storage statistics

## Storage Optimization

The system uses SHA-256 hash to identify duplicate files:

1. When a file is uploaded, its hash is calculated
2. If the hash already exists, a new reference is created to the existing content
3. Reference counting tracks how many files point to each unique content
4. When a file is deleted, its reference count is decremented
5. If reference count reaches zero, the actual file content is deleted

This approach significantly reduces storage requirements when the same file is uploaded multiple times.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any TypeScript errors related to the `File` type:
- We've renamed our custom `File` interface to `FileData` to avoid conflicts with the built-in JavaScript `File` type
- We've fixed the dependency warnings in the React effects by properly using `useCallback` to memoize functions

If you encounter Django migration errors:
- Make sure you've copied the correct initial migration file into the `backend/files/migrations/` directory
- You may need to remove any existing SQLite database file and let Django create a new one
